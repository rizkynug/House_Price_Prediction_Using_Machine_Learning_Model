# House_Price_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning_Models

## 📌 Project Description
This project aims to model house prices based on various features in the dataset using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains data about house characteristics such as lot size, year built, amenities, and sale price.

## 🎯 Goals
- Create a accurate house price prediction model using different machine learning algorithms.
- Compare the performance of these models to select the best one based on relevant evaluation metrics.
- Provide insights into the factors that influence house prices and how to model them effectively.

## 📊 Business Impact
Having a model that can accurately predict house prices allows real estate companies to improve business decisions related to pricing, sales, and property purchases. It can also enhance customer satisfaction by providing more precise pricing information.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: GradientBoostingRegressor, Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Jupyter Notebook**, **VS Code**

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle with various features. Due to data size, the dataset is not included in this repository but can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
